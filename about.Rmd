Welcome! My name is Catie Kitrinos and I am a second year MA/PhD student in Dr. Jason Kamilar's Comparative Primatology Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. For my Master's Thesis, I am investigating the ways in which the diversity and composition of hair-associated microbial communities differ across primate body regions, genders, species, and institutions. I am hoping to do my dissertation work on microbial transmission across species (bats, baboons, fruits, and humans) at Kasanka National Park in Zambia.
